the containsKey in the EmployeeInfo will look for equal and hashing and since
no override of hashing is there. the result is false.

this shows that for every  equal override, hashcode override is needed

the class will result true if we override the hashcode

 @Override
 public int hashCode()
 {
	 return Objects.hash(name,salary);
}
