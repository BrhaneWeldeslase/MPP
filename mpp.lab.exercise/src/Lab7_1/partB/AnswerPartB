the reason the result is returning false
is the equal method in the employee class is not override the Object equal method.

in order to achieve that we should implement the equal using this,

     public boolean equals(Object e) {
		Employee emp=(Employee)e;
		return emp.name.equals(name) && emp.salary == salary;
	}
